# 1. Installation
- Copy "LARA" from [wad\fixlara.wad2](wad/fixlara.wad2) into your WAD.


# 2. FAQ

## 2.1. Why do I need to use Tomb Editor for this?
The only program that allows us to edit old WAD files is WADMerger, which has the unfortunate side effect that corrupts every animation a tiny bit. Using the new Wad2 format allows me to keep the animations in the best sate they can possibly be in.

## 2.2. Do I need to use TRNG for this?
Yes and no. The animations themselves can be used even with the original game engine. However, there are some tweaks that require TRNG specific features, such as scripting and plugins.

## 2.3. Can I only use this with the TR4 engine?
There are plans to create a version for each of the classic engines, but for now I will focus exclusively on the TR4 engine.


# 3. Note about encryption
A simple request:
> If you are going to **encrypt your levels**, then please **do not use this project**.

I don't agree with encryption for many reasons, and I'll just sum it up this way: when making your game, you're using software, assets, tutorials, advices, etc... which are all **community effort**. Community effort is what kept Tomb Raider level editing going after 20 years.

My project is following the same spirit. If you want to encrypt your levels, well it's your choice, but then I ask you to not use any of my stuff in it. Thank you.
