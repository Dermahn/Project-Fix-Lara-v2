# 1. Note about encryption
A simple request:
> If you are going to **encrypt your levels**, then please **do not use this project**.

I don't agree with encryption for many reasons, and I'll just sum it up this way: when making your game, you're using software, assets, tutorials, advices, etc... which are all **community effort**. Community effort is what kept Tomb Raider level editing going after 20 years.

My project is following the same spirit. If you want to encrypt your levels, well it's your choice, but then I ask you to not use any of my stuff in it. Thank you.
